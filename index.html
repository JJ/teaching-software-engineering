                    <aside class='notes'>Error messages are informative, stateful, typed, and all kind of things. They don't dump the memory in a file with a stack to dig into and find where your pointer went off base. They are actionable, and tell you what you can do about them. Teaching how to interpret and what to do about errors will save them trips to StackOverflow and the bashing that often goes with the first experiences.</aside>

                <section>
                    <h1>and multi-paradigm programming is the new procedural programming</h1>
                    <aside class='notes'>Modern programming includes a lot of semi-low-level concepts that need to be understood. Even object and classes are something that is very basic; monads and lambda calculus too, and even category theory is needed to understand type systems. And this has to be taught <em>along</em> with the new languages, as natural concepts, not before because it would be boring or after because it will not be really understood. Batteries must be included, which means that you have to load the programming language with the concepts needed to understand it, and do it from the get go. If it is a multiparadigm, devote a few of asides to explain the paradigms and when to use them.</aside>
